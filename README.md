# Railway Management System DatabaseðŸš†

## Current System
A Railway Reservation System is one which helps us to reserve or cancel seats in train. When we want to travel from one place to another place. Since it is difficult to maintain a record of all information manually, we have created it with the help of an E-R diagram, many tables. It consists of several steps to be followed and many forms to be maintained i.e for the convenience of the passengers.

## Advantages of the proposed system
Through this system, we try to achieve the below objectives:
1. To inform users about their reservation status.
2. Available seats and price of ticket.
3. Schedules of different trains
4. Provides the details of the various stations from the source to the destination to the passenger.
5. To Reduce cost, occur on management.
6. Provides info for Train Fare & distance
7. Prevents users from getting invalid information.
